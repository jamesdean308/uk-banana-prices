# uk-banana-prices
Have you ever found yourself wanting to visualise the average wholesale prices of bananas by country of origin in the UK? Well now you can with this simple Dash app.

This application will load the freshest available banana data straight from gov.uk and allow you to filter by *country of origin* and *date*.

Simply install `requirements.txt` in the environment of your choice, and run `python .\src\app.py`. By default you should be able to visit the Dash app at `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`.
